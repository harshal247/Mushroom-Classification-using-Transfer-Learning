# Mushroom-Classification-using-Transfer-Learning
For this image classification problem, a convolutional neural network (CNN) with transfer learning was used. ResNet-50, a pre-trained model, provided the foundation. The model was retrained with the new data set using fine-tuning, with the end result being a classification of mushroom species based on an image input.
