Foraging for edible wild mushrooms – mushroom hunting – has become a popular pastime for hikers, gourmands, and the curious alike. There are, however, thousands of species of mushrooms and only a small number of them are safe to eat. As such, it is essential – particularly for novice foragers – to properly identify any mushrooms prior to handling them and, most especially, prior to eating them. This is not an easy task: There is no single characteristic that is common to all safe mushrooms, and vice versa. Moreover, a number of poisonous varieties look nearly identical to their edible counterparts, and others are safe to eat when they are young but not when they are older. Identifying an edible mushroom, then, can be challenging even for experienced foragers. A mobile app built around a program that identifies and classifies mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on an image would provide a user-friendly solution to this problem.
Reliable methods of identifying mushrooms, preferably while foragers are still in the field, is key to safely enjoying this burgeoning hobby. The risk associated with a misidentification is substantial, potentially even deadly, so creating a model that avoids false identifications is crucial and adds a layer of required accuracy to such an undertaking. For purposes of training the model presented here, a data set with a limited number of images and mushroom species was used: roughly 9,500 images of mushrooms belonging to 12 distinct mushroom species. The developed framework, however, could be expanded to include potentially thousands of species.
For this image classification problem, a convolutional neural network (CNN) with transfer learning was used. ResNet-50, a pre-trained model, provided the foundation. The model was retrained with the new data set using fine-tuning, with the end result being a classification of mushroom species based on an image input. Competing methods, such as regression and forests, were also considered; these methods were deemed less advantageous because they could lead to unreasonable training times, may not be as accurate, and might result in overfitting/underfitting.
Key components of this approach include preprocessing and validation. Preprocessing the image data made it possible to train the CNN model using a subset of the original image inventory (the training set). Validation of the resulting CNN model was carried out using the remaining images (the test set). Here, an essential component of the results is the accuracy of the model predictions. The error rate of the model is important to evaluate because, for this problem in particular, the risk associated with a false identification may be substantial.
